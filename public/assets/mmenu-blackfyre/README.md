mmenu-Bootstrap-3
=================

This is an iteration of purgeru's original version of the integration. Which can be found at https://github.com/purgeru/mmenu-Bootstrap-3

What's changed:
* Added mmenu and bootstrap as bower dependencies
* updated include paths to support bower
* fixed the mmenu initializations

Left sliding mmenu navigation on small and regular navigation on large devices with Bootstrap 3 integration
